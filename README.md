# PasswordGenerator
Made a password generator in Java, which uses both uppercase and lowercase letters, also numbers and symbols.
It does this by using the Math.random function and then it will get converted to an ASCII number that coincides with a symbol, number, or letter. 
It then takes those randomly generated characters and puts it in an array and then displays it to the user.
